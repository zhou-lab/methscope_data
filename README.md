# MethScope Data

This repository holds data to test MethScope.

**MethScope** identifies Most Recurrent Methylation Patterns (MRMPs) as the basis to encode latent representations for interpretatble analysis of DNA mehtylation data, in particular single cell and spatial methylome. The MRMPs embeddings will support automatic **cell annotation**, **bulk deconvolution**, **unsupervisded clustering**, and **cancer cell of origin prediction**. 

## Installation

Install the released version of usethis from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("MethScope")
```

or install from github

```r
devtools::install_github("zhou-lab/MethScope")
```

## Usage 

**MethScope** performs rapid cell annotation, deconvolution and other tasks for single cell and spatial DNA methylome. Please check out our documentation for more details:
